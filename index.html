        <h1>Sam Phipps</h1>
        <p>I love puzzles, and not the kind with pieces. This includes technical problems in programming, 
            but also card games and role playing games with my friends. If I am not solving puzzles, you can find me outside. 
            My family and I spend much of our free time hunting, fishing, hiking, and gardening among other outdoor activities. 
            p.s. I am currently working on my dad joke repertoire so please share any you think I should add to my portfolio!

                        This was my first ever webpage. Built with html and css after learning the basics online. 
                        I used it as an application for Prime Digital Academy.
                        This project was the stepping stone to my career as a developer, and I definitely 
                        caught the bug. It is wonderful to look back at a project and realize how far I have
                        come.

                        This was my full fledged Single Page Application with routing and full page renders depending on the route.
                        It was designed as a feedback form to provide instructors feedback on the day's lesson/lessons. 
                        It was also my first use of Redux as a way to manage global state. As the user goes through the app an object is created in redux, which is 
                        then send to the server and subsequently to the database on the submission confirmation.
